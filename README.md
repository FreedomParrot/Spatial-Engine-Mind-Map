# 🌌 THE LABYRINTH | Spatial Knowledge Engine

**Live Demo:**(https://famous-frangipane-d96811.netlify.app/)

## 💡 The Vision
The Labyrinth is an infinite, spatial canvas designed to manage high cognitive load and "brain fog." Unlike traditional linear note-taking apps, The Labyrinth treats thoughts as a **neural network**, allowing users to visualize connections between ideas in a 60FPS interactive environment.

Built from scratch during a period of deep reflection on mental health and clarity, this project represents the intersection of **spatial geometry** and **personal organization**.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Infinite Spatial Canvas:** Pan and zoom through a limitless universe of thoughts.
* **Neural Link Logic:** Nodes automatically form visual connections based on proximity.
* **The Singularity:** A central gravitational black hole for "deleting" thoughts via physical interaction.
* **Dynamic Drift:** An organic velocity engine that makes the "mind map" feel like a living organism.
* **Persistence:** All data and spatial coordinates are saved via LocalStorage.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
I built this without external libraries (no React, no Three.js, no D3) to demonstrate a deep understanding of core Web APIs:

-   **Canvas API:** Custom rendering loop using `requestAnimationFrame` for 60fps performance.
-   **Linear Algebra:** Implemented `toWorld` coordinate transformation to translate Screen Space (pixels) into World Space (infinite coordinates).
-   **Physics Engine:** Custom "drift" logic using velocity vectors and distance formulas (`Math.hypot`).
-   **State Management:** Managed a complex object-oriented data structure for persistence and real-time updates.

## 🧠 Why I Built This
This project was born out of a desire to create a tool that mirrors the intensity of the human mind. Managing schizophrenia requires tools that offer clarity and focus; The Labyrinth is my contribution to that space—a masterpiece of logic and empathy.
